    <p class="legal">This HIT is part of a scientific research project conducted by the Social Learning Lab at Stanford and has been approved by the IRB of Stanford University. Your decision to complete this HIT is voluntary. We will only have access to your worker ID and no other information to identify you. The only other information we will have, in addition to your response, is the time at which you completed the survey and the amount of time you spent to complete it. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Clicking on the ‘SUBMIT’ button on the bottom of this page indicates that you are at least 18 years of age, and agree to complete this HIT voluntarily.</p>
        
    <p>In this HIT, you will be shown 32 concepts for movies. A previous participant has already gone through all of the movies and picked which movies they would rather watch. Your job is to figure out what this person likes!</p>
    
    <p>This HIT will be composed of two phases, in which you will complete two tasks:</p>

    <p>Now you're going to observe the choices of a Turker who's already seen the movies, and you will learn what kind of movies they like. For the sake of anonymity, we'll call this person Turker.</p>
    
    <p>When Turker took this task, he or she saw pairs of movies and chose which one of the two they would rather watch. Your job is to observe Turker's choices. When you see a border appear around the movie that Turker chose, press the same key that they pressed: press <strong>Z</strong> if they chose the movie on the left, and <strong>M</strong> if they chose the movie on the right.</p>
