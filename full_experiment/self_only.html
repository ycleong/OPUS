    <p class="legal">This HIT is part of a scientific research project conducted by the Social Learning Lab at Stanford and has been approved by the IRB of Stanford University. Your decision to complete this HIT is voluntary. We will only have access to your worker ID and no other information to identify you. The only other information we will have, in addition to your response, is the time at which you completed the survey and the amount of time you spent to complete it. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Clicking on the ‘SUBMIT’ button on the bottom of this page indicates that you are at least 18 years of age, and agree to complete this HIT voluntarily.</p>
    
    <p>This HIT is composed of 2 phases. In each phase, you will view and answer questions about a different set of 16 concepts for movies. Each phase is composed of two tasks:</p>
    <h2>Task 1: Meet the Movies (16 trials)</h2>
    <p>In this task, you will read the plot of 16 movie concepts and answer an easy multiple-choice comprehension question about the movie. You will immediately receive feedback on your answer and have the chance to try again until you get it right. In this part of the experiment, it's important that you understand and become familiarized with the movies, so please pay attention!</p>
    
    <h2>Task 2: Choose Movies (56 trials) </h2>
    <p>In this phase of the experiment, you'll see the movie posters come up two at a time. Please use the <strong>Z and M keys</strong> on your keyboard to indicate which movie you would rather watch. (We will remind you about the controls before you start the task.)</p>
    
    <p>In total, you will answer 32 multiple-choice questions and pick between 112 pairs of movies. The HIT should take 20 minutes. Please pay attention. Thanks!</p>
